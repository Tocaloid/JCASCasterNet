## Introduction

This repository contains the source code for the following paper [1].

[1] Y. Zhang et al., "AI Empowered Channel Semantic Acquisition for 6G Integrated Sensing and Communication Networks," in IEEE Network, doi: 10.1109/MNET.2024.3354264.

Considering the correlation between C&S channels, we propose a two-stage frame structure along with the channel semantic learning based JCASCasterNet, which yield gains in both extraction and reconstruction of channel semantic.
